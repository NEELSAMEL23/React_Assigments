        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This assignment introduces you to custom hooks in React, which allow you to extract reusable logic from
            components into standalone functions. You will learn how to create custom hooks and use them to encapsulate
            common functionality in your React applications. By completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational
            understanding of custom hooks and their benefits in React development.</p>

            Problem Statement
        </h3>
        <p>You are tasked with creating custom hooks in a React application. Follow these guidelines:

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Define Custom Hooks: Create custom hooks that encapsulate specific functionality, such as, handling form
                state.</li>
            <li>Extract Reusable Logic: Identify common logic or behavior in your React components that can be extracted
                into custom hooks. Write custom hooks to encapsulate this logic and make it reusable across multiple
                components.</li>
            <li>Implement Custom Hooks: Integrate custom hooks into your React components by calling them and utilizing
                the returned values or functions.</li>
            <li>Test Custom Hooks: Verify that your custom hooks work correctly by using them in various components and
                scenarios within your application.</li>
        </ol>
