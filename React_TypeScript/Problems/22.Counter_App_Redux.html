        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This assignment introduces you to Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. You will
            learn the basic concepts of Redux and how to integrate it into a simple JavaScript application. By
            completing this assignment, you will gain a foundational understanding of Redux and its core principles.</p>
        <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>

        <h3>Topics</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Understanding Redux and its purpose</li>
            <li>Setting up Redux in a JavaScript application</li>
            <li>Creating actions, reducers, and the store</li>
            <li>Dispatching actions to update the state</li>
            <li>Accessing state data from the store</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>You have been tasked with building a simple counter application using React and Redux. The application should
            allow users to increment and decrement a counter value. However, managing the state of the counter using
            React's local state is becoming cumbersome and prone to errors. To address these issues, you have decided to
            integrate Redux into the application to manage the counter state more efficiently</p>
        <p>You are tasked with integrating Redux into a JavaScript application. Follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Setup Redux: Initialize a Redux store with an initial state and a reducer function.</li>
            <li>Define Actions: Create action types and action creators to represent different actions that can be
                performed in the application.</li>
            <li>Implement Reducers: Write reducer functions to handle each action type and update the state accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>Dispatch Actions: Dispatch actions to the store to trigger state updates.</li>
            <li>Access State: Access state data from the store and display it in the application.</li>
            <li>Display data: Display the data in stringified format.</li>
        </ol>
