        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This assignment focuses on integrating React with Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript
            applications. You will learn how to set up a React application with Redux and manage state efficiently using
            Redux principles. By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in integrating Redux
            into React applications and understand how to organize Redux logic within a React project.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Setting up Redux in a React application</li>
            <li>Creating actions, reducers, and the Redux store</li>
            <li>Connecting React components to the Redux store</li>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>You have been assigned to create a simple todo list application using React and Redux. The application should
            allow users to add new todos, mark todos as completed, and delete todos. Managing the state of todos using
            React's local state has become inefficient, so you have decided to integrate Redux into the application to
            manage the todo state more effectively.</p>
        <p>You are tasked with integrating Redux into a JavaScript application. Follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Redux Setup: Initialize a Redux store with an initial state and a reducer function.</li>
            <li>React Integration: Connect React components to the Redux store using the hooks provided by react-redux.
            </li>
            <li>Define Actions: Create action types and action creators to represent different actions that can be
                performed in the application.</li>
            <li>Implement Reducers: Write reducer functions to handle each action type and update the Redux state
                accordingly.</li>
            <li>Dispatch Actions: Dispatch actions to the Redux store from React components to trigger state updates.
            </li>
            <li>Access State: Access state data from the Redux store in React components using mapStateToProps function.
            </li>
            <li>Structure of todo :</li>
            
            <div style="width: 900px; background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221);   border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px;">
                const todo = {<br>
                title: "string",<br>
                status: "boolean"<br>
                id: "UniqueId"<br>
                }

            </div>
        </ol>
