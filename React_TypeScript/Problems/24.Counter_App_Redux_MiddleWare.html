        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This assignment introduces you to Redux Middleware in a React application. Middleware provides a way to
            extend Redux with custom functionality such as logging, asynchronous actions, or handling side effects. You
            will learn how to apply middleware to a Redux store and use it to enhance the capabilities of Redux in your
            React application. By completing this assignment, you will gain a basic understanding of Redux Middleware
            and its usage in React projects.</p>
